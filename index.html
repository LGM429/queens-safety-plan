			<p class="intro">
				Fed up with people dying while walking or biking, local lawmakers in Western Queens came up with their own plan to reduce overall traffic deaths in the city. Cyclist deaths in particular are on the rise, <a href="https://projects.transalt.org/lessons-from-vision-zero-new-york-city" target="_blank">citywide.</a>
            </p>
			<p>
				In 2023, 14 pedestrians and cyclists were killed after 1,077 crashes in the area, which ranges from Long Island City to Maspeth and from Astoria to Corona, according to <a href= "https://crashmapper.org/#/?cfat=true&cinj=true&endDate=2023-12&geo=custom&identifier=&lat=40.73308000062968&lng=-73.88477325439453&lngLats=%255B%255B-73.90623092651367%252C40.79002965177114%255D%252C%255B-73.88288497924805%252C40.782491176741395%255D%252C%255B-73.8555908203125%252C40.76897176836408%255D%252C%255B-73.85168552398682%252C40.75268632918293%255D%252C%255B-73.84936809539795%252C40.74810228251459%255D%252C%255B-73.84546279907227%252C40.739843698929995%255D%252C%255B-73.85284423828125%252C40.73714480561841%255D%252C%255B-73.86035442352295%252C40.73561646807697%255D%252C%255B-73.86928081512451%252C40.73252716796685%255D%252C%255B-73.87988090515137%252C40.7290474687069%255D%252C%255B-73.88588905334473%252C40.72774659982564%255D%252C%255B-73.88490200042725%252C40.722412771544384%255D%252C%255B-73.88734817504883%252C40.71525696471578%255D%252C%255B-73.89018058776855%252C40.709141393000124%255D%252C%255B-73.89378547668457%252C40.71206913039633%255D%252C%255B-73.90352725982666%252C40.712622133005986%255D%252C%255B-73.91790390014648%252C40.71330524753563%255D%252C%255B-73.92399787902832%252C40.71385823987876%255D%252C%255B-73.92416954040527%252C40.720136007355364%255D%252C%255B-73.92893314361572%252C40.727876687858114%255D%252C%255B-73.93863201141357%252C40.730575957147444%255D%252C%255B-73.94094944000244%252C40.734640915118035%255D%252C%255B-73.94511222839355%252C40.7374699792888%255D%252C%255B-73.95283699035645%252C40.739843698929995%255D%252C%255B-73.96219253540039%252C40.73854304112388%255D%252C%255B-73.95927429199219%252C40.74563131777544%255D%252C%255B-73.94845962524413%252C40.75840781634638%255D%252C%255B-73.94172191619873%252C40.76624155398039%255D%252C%255B-73.93532752990723%252C40.77010932458492%255D%252C%255B-73.93519878387451%252C40.7717018705776%255D%252C%255B-73.9374303817749%252C40.77231937814184%255D%252C%255B-73.93730163574219%252C40.77657677410218%255D%252C%255B-73.93189430236816%252C40.77781169287529%255D%252C%255B-73.92979145050049%252C40.776544275929716%255D%252C%255B-73.92301082611084%252C40.780021490225984%255D%252C%255B-73.91824722290039%252C40.784245898199636%255D%252C%255B-73.91507148742676%252C40.787300302741144%255D%252C%255B-73.90623092651367%252C40.79002965177114%255D%255D&mfat=false&minj=false&noInjFat=false&pfat=true&pinj=true&startDate=2023-01&vbicycle=true&vbusvan=true&vcar=true&vmotorcycle=true&vother=true&vscooter=true&vsuv=true&vtruck=true&zoom=12" target="_blank">publicly available city data.</a> There were 416 cyclists injured in the same span.

            <p> 
                “I have to ride on the sidewalk sometimes,” said Sterling Rodriguez, a resident of Astoria, to avoid car traffic on busy streets and avenues. More than nine in ten cyclist fatalities happen on streets without a protected bike lane, <a href="https://transalt.org/press-releases/new-york-city-is-on-track-to-have-the-deadliest-year-for-bike-riders-since-1999-new-data-from-transportation-alternatives-and-families-for-safe-streets-shows#:~:text=94%25%20of%20bike%20riders%20killed,all%20road%20users%20by%2018.1%25." target="_blank">according to a report</a> from Transportation Alternatives, a traffic safety group. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://lede-admin.nyc.streetsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/48/2023/11/Western-Queens-Street-Safety-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Western Queens Street Safety Plan</a>, announced last month, calls for improved cycling infrastructure and universal daylighting – the removal of parking spaces closest to the crosswalk to improve visibility – as well as investing in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to make it “excellent, reliable, and accessible.”  
            </p>
            <p>
                The plan, backed by State Assemblymember Jessica Gonzáles-Rojas, State Senator Kristen Gonzalez, and City Councilmembers Tiffany Cabán and Zohran Mamdani, emerged after the death of 7-year-old Dolma Naadhun, according to Nomi Tinkelman, organizing director for Councilmember Cabán. Naadhun was killed by an SUV driver who ran a stop sign in Astoria in February.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We kind of noticed this pattern of DOT being willing to make changes to certain intersections after tragedies happened, and like many advocates in this area, felt that that was unacceptable,” said Tinkelman, referring to the city’s department of transportation.
            </p>
            <P> 
                Tinkelman’s team reached out to the Queens division of the transportation department to find ways to be more proactive in preventing deaths, particularly at intersections that community members had identified as dangerous. 
            </P>
			<p>
                “We weren’t totally satisfied with that conversation,” she said. After some back and forth with the Queens division, her team decided to put a plan together themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                “We’re hoping to continue working with DOT to make these things happen,” she added. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Two days after the western Queens plan was announced, Mayor Adams issued his <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/916-23/transcript-mayor-adams-launches-new-effort-make-thousands-nyc-intersections-safer-of" target="_blank">own street safety plan</a> in direct response to the traffic death of 7-year-old Kamari Hughes by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/nyregion/nypd-tow-truck-boy-killed.html" target="_blank">police tow truck operator</a> in Fort Greene in October. The press conference came the morning after 3-year-old Quintus Chen was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/30/nyregion/hit-run-boy-killed-queens.html" target="_blank">killed in a hit and run</a> in Flushing.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mayor’s plan called for daylighting 1,000 intersections per year. It also called for the inclusion of traffic fatalities on CompStat, the city’s public crime tracker which publishes data on serious crimes, such as murders and robberies. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The two plans come almost a decade after former Mayor DeBlasio rolled out <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/visionzero/pdf/nyc-vision-zero-action-plan.pdf" target="_blank">Vision Zero,</a> his plan to reduce traffic deaths in New York, in 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
                Vision Zero, which introduced broad changes to the way the city would address street safety, made significant progress during the first few years following the launch, including a successful campaign to lobby the state to reduce the citywide speed limit to 25 mph. 
            </p>
            <p>
                However, progress has slowed. 
            </p>

In <a href="https://crashmapper.org/#/?cfat=true&cinj=true&endDate=2018-12&geo=citywide&identifier=&lat=40.732949922769336&lng=-73.88442993164062&lngLats=%255B%255D&mfat=true&minj=true&noInjFat=false&pfat=true&pinj=true&startDate=2018-01&vbicycle=true&vbusvan=true&vcar=true&vmotorcycle=true&vother=true&vscooter=true&vsuv=true&vtruck=true&zoom=12" target="_blank">2018,</a> this figure dropped to 230, but rose again during the pandemic: last year, traffic crashes <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-traffic-deaths-in-2022-up-from-pre-pandemic-levels-near-equal-to-shooting-deaths" target="_blank">claimed 268 lives,</a> about the same number of people killed by guns in New York. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This year, Jon Orcutt, the director for advocacy at Bike New York, estimates the figure will be around 270. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Orcutt, the former director of policy at the New York City Department of Transportation, said that the biggest piece missing in the city’s Vision Zero plan is mayoral leadership.
            </p>
            <p>
                “There hasn’t been any real political steam behind Vision Zero since about 2015 or ‘16,” said Orcutt. DeBlasio’s interest died out after a few years, he said. “And Mayor Adams has zero interest in this stuff, actually.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for the mayor, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/26/nyregion/nypd-tow-truck-boy-killed.html" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> in October that the rise in cycling and pedestrian deaths was largely attributable to cyclist fatalities, a pattern that’s also true in western Queens.
            </p>
            <p>Citywide, approximately 75,000 New Yorkers typically commuted to work by bicycle in 2022, according to the <a href="https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S0801?q=New%20York%20bike%20to%20work&g=160XX00US3651000" target="_blank">Census Bureau.</a>  
            </p>
            <p>
                “Cycling infrastructure has not kept pace,” Jackson Chabot, advocacy director for Open Plans, a street safety nonprofit, said, “with usage, the interest, and the demand.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Astoria resident Kimberly Rivera, 59, said she stopped biking after a bad accident. “It’s too scary."

            <p> 
                According to the Department of Transportation, the agency has installed more than 10 miles of protected bike lanes recently, including on Queens Boulevard. In October, the mayor announced a plan to <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/766-23/mayor-adams-launches-historic-greenway-expansion-more-40-miles-new-greenways-five#/0" target="_blank">design 60 miles of greenway,</a> including the Queens Waterfront Greenway which would line the north and western Queens waterfront.
            </p>
            <p>
                A <a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3954291&GUID=D37BA0B0-9AB6-434B-A82E-E49A7895A1A4&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search=transportation+master+plan" target="_blank">2019 law</a> required the city Department of Transportation to deliver 50 miles of protected bike lanes a year for the next five years. According to a <a href="https://projects.transalt.org/bikelanes#smp" target="_blank"> tracker run by Transportation Alternatives,</a> only 38.6 miles were built in 2023.  
            </p>
            <p>
                “We suck at public construction in New York,” said Orcutt, of the type of street enhancements that go beyond using paint to denote bike lanes. “We don’t do very much of it, and we do it very slowly,” he added. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Still, Tinkelman feels fairly optimistic about getting a number of the provisions in the western Queens plan completed by 2030, particularly as it relates to her team’s relationship with the Queens Department of Transportation, who she met with before releasing the plan. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “They seemed very willing to work together to make it happen, or at least make as much of it happen as possible – we know that it’s very ambitious,” she said.
